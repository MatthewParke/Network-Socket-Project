# Network-Socket-Project
A simple client server connection project for my systems class


In this program I had to create a client app that conncected to a school server, request a problem from the server, solve it locally,
then send the solution back. Some of the comments in the csapp.c file are from my systems teacher, but I left them becasue they still
are useful for outlining the code. I have starred out (****) some of the hardcoded information in the client.c file for privacies sake.
